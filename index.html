  <h1>Tutorials</h1>
  <p>Tutorials will help in understanding modern toolsets, methodologies, and industry standards. These tutorials will also help prepare you for the final project that you will submit in Module 8. In these tutorials, we will explore content outside of your text, as well as reinforce content that you have read about while implementing it in a "real world" fashion. In these tutorials, you will often be coding with another instructor/video (often known as a code-a-long), so be sure to follow the videos/resources carefully. Also be sure to read each section carefully, as each tutorial might have different requirements and setups.</p>
